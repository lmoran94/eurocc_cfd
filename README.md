Repository of a basic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code using a Jacobi iterator to solve for a fluid in a box. The base problem is a square box with an inlet on one side and an outlet on another.

The C and Fortran codes are from a Practical Introduction to HPC Masters level course taught at EPCC, University of Edinburgh. I developed the Rust code to implement the same algorithm. The implementation is naive in all three languages. 

NOTE: The plotting work for the Rust version is incomplete.
